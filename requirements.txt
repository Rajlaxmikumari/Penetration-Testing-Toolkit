## Ethical Considerations

1. **Legal Compliance**: Only use this toolkit on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
2. **Disclosure**: Always report vulnerabilities responsibly to system owners.
3. **Safety**: Some modules (like brute forcing) can disrupt services - use carefully in production environments.
4. **Privacy**: Don't store sensitive data from tests longer than necessary.

## Extensibility

The toolkit is designed to be easily extended:

1. Add new modules to the `modules/` directory
2. Create new utility functions in `utils/`
3. Extend the CLI interface in `ptt.py`

Each module should follow the pattern of having a clear interface and using the shared logging/reporting utilities.

This toolkit provides a solid foundation for penetration testing activities while maintaining modularity and extensibility. Always remember to use such tools ethically and legally.
